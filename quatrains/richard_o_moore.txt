We made our peace;
Stood still in October
In the failing light and sought,
Each in the other, ease
 
And release from silence,
From the slow damnation
Of speech that is weak
And falls from silence.
 
In the October sun
By the green river we spoke,
Late in October, the leaves
Of the water maples had fallen.
