The anguish of the earth absolves our eyes 
Till beauty shines in all that we can see. 
War is our scourge; yet war has made us wise, 
And, fighting for our freedom, we are free.
 
Horror of wounds and anger at the foe, 
And loss of things desired; all these must pass. 
We are the happy legion, for we know 
Time's but a golden wind that shakes the grass.
