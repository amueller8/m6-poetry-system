The sun used to shine while we two walked
Slowly together, paused and started
Again, and sometimes mused, sometimes talked
As either pleased, and cheerfully parted

When the tide covers it late or soon,
And other men through other flowers
In those fields under the same moon
Go talking and have easy hours.
