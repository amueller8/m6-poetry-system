SSo, because you chose to follow me into the subtle sadness of night,
    And to stand in the half-set moon with the weird fall-light on your glimmering hair,
Till your presence hid all of the earth and all of the sky from my sight,
    And to give me a little scarlet bud, that was dying of frost, to wear,
 
Say, must you taunt me forever, forever? You looked at my hand and you knew
    That I was the slave of the Ring, while you were as free as the wind is free.
When I saw your corpse in your coffin, I flung back your flower to you;
    It was all of yours that I ever had; you may keep it, andâ€”keep from me.
